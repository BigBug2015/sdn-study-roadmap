# SDN Learning Roadmap 2018
> Roadmap to learning Software Defined Networking in 2018

Below, you can find a set of charts that need to be learn to master Software Defined Networking (SDN). I made this roadmap to help other and very open into suggestion.

### Requirement
---
When you want to learn SDN, you must master the programming. below is the images how you will learn the programming path.

</p>

You need to choose the language, im recommend python for you because mayne people use this language and its easy to learn. You need to master API & data flow between the API (JSON,XML).

### Introduction
---

You must learn all of this to better understanding about software defined networking.

### Network Programability & Automation

</p>

Im recommend you to learn the `IT Automation` software like Ansible. Mastering the protocol `netconf` and some python modules to support automation.

### Hybrid Software Defined Networking
---

</p>

Hybrid Software Defined Networking is focusing on `NETCONF+YANG`, Its better to understanding `YANG Data Modeling` and some tools like ncclient & yang-explorer.

### Pure Software Defined Networking

</p>

Pure SDN its more about `openflow`, try to understanding the protocol before learn `P4`.
